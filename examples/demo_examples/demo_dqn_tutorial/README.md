# DQN Tutorial: Implementation and Validation of a Deep RL Agent


In this folder, you'll find the example of a small project
that hows show to implement DQN from scratch, visualize training data
with tensorboard, and use gridworlds for debugging.

Follow the steps below:

* Check the script `dqn_agent.py`, which contains a class implementing the DQN agent. Examples of neural nets that can be used by DQN are in the script `dqn_nets.py`.

* Check and run the script `dqn_run.py`, which also explains how to launch tensorboard to visualize training data.
