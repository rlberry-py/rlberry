class BanditTracker(DefaultWriter):
    """
    Container class for rewards and various statistics (means...) collected
    during the run of a bandit algorithm.

    BanditTracker is a companion class for
    :class:`~rlberry.agents.bandits.BanditWithSimplePolicy` (and other agents
    based on it), where a default tracker is automatically constructed, and can
    then be used e.g as an entry for an index function.

    It inherits the logic of DefaultWriter to write/store/read
    various data of interest for the execution of a bandit agent.

    Data are stored in the data attribute and indexed by a specific tag.
    Except for the tag "t" (corresponding to the running total number of time
    steps played by the agent), all tags are arm-specific (n_pulls,
    total_reward...). Each tag entry is stored as a deque with fixed maximum
    length (FIFO). By default, this maximum length is set to 1, i.e each new
    update to the tag erases the previously stored entry. The maximum length
    can be changed on a tag-by-tag basis with the dict maxlen_by_tag.

    Data can be interacted with by using the following DefaultWriter accessors:
        * Read:
            * read_last_tag_value(tag, arm)): returns the last entry of the
            deque corresponding to arm-specific tag.
            * read_tag_value(tag, arm)): returns the full deque corresponding
            to the arm-specific tag.
        * Write:
            * add_scalar(tag, value): add a single scalar value to the deque
            corresponding to the tag.
            * add_scalars(arm, {tags: values}): add multiple arm-specific
            tagged values to each corresponding deque.

    For ease of use, wrapper methods are provided to access common tag such as
    t, n_pulls, total_reward... without explicitly calling the
    read_last_tag_value/read_tag_value methods.

    Parameters
    ----------
    agent: rlberry bandit agent
        See :class:`~rlberry.agents.bandits`.

    params: dict
        Other parameters to condition what to store and compute.
        In particuler if params contains store_rewards=True, the
        rewards will be saved for each arm at each step and if
        store_actions=True, the actions are saved.
        It can also contain a function named "update" that will
        be called at the end of the update phase. def update(tr, arm): ...


    Examples
    --------
    >>>  def index(tr):
         ''' Compute UCB index for rewards in [0,1]'''
         return [
            tr.mu_hat(arm) +  np.sqrt(
                0.5 * np.log(1 / delta(tr.t))) / tr.n_pulls(arm)
            )
            for arm in tr.arms
          ]
