    Modifications with respect to source:

    * Remove chex typing from the arguments.
    * Log using a logger :code:`logging.getLogger(__name__)` instead of :code:`logging.info()`.
    * Changed documentation style.

    Parameters
    ----------
    init_value: float
        Initial value for the scalar to be annealed.
    end_value: float
        End value of the scalar to be annealed.
    power: float
        The power of the polynomial used to transition from init to end.
    transition_steps: float
        Number of steps over which annealing takes place,
        the scalar starts changing at `transition_begin` steps and completes
        the transition by `transition_begin + transition_steps` steps.
        If `transition_steps <= 0`, then the entire annealing process is disabled
        and the value is held fixed at `init_value`.
    transition_begin: float
        Must be positive. After how many steps to start annealing
        (before this many steps the scalar value is held fixed at `init_value`).

    Returns
    -------
    schedule: Callable[[int], float]
        A function that maps step counts to values.
