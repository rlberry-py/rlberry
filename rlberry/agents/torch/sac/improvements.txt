1) Usage of class memory for SAC is not the best. I believe replay buffer should be more efficient.
2) Implement continuous action space, by learning gaussian distribution for actions
3) Implement convolutional backbone
4) policy loss: should it be like in the original paper? For now it is like in Maxim Lapan


Stuff to check:
1) maybe performing k_epochs on the same batch is not the optimal way of doing things
