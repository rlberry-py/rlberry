# User Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to rlberry.
Use rlberry's [ExperimentManager](experimentManager_page) to train, evaluate and compare rl agents.
Like other popular rl libraries, rlberry also provides basic tools for plotting, multiprocessing and logging  <!-- TODO :(add refs)-->. In this user guide, we take you through the core features of rlberry and illustrate them with [examples](/auto_examples/index) and [API documentation](/api) .

To run all the examples, you will need to install other libraries like "[rlberry-scool](https://github.com/rlberry-py/rlberry-scool)" (and others).
 <!-- TODO : Add some code with the best solution to install them: poetry?, pip?, github link ??? -->
The easiest way to do it is :
```none
pip install rlberry[torch,extras]
pip install rlberry-scool
```

[rlberry-scool](https://github.com/rlberry-py/rlberry-scool) :
It's the repository used for teaching purposes. These are mainly basic agents and environments, in a version that makes it easier for students to learn.

You can find more details about installation [here](installation)!
